# The final project will take what was learned in class and will be used create a program for the following situation:

# You are the manager of several stores.  You need to keep track of the amount of money that comes in from all of the stores. To accommodate this situation you decide to make a python program that will ask you the name or location of each store you manage. For each store, the program will ask that you enter in the following values: 100's, 50's, 20's, 10's 5's, 1's, quarters, dimes, nickles, and pennies, the program will take those values and add them to give the store total. The program will then take all the store totals and will calculate a grand total for all stores. Finally the program should ask the user if they want to save the information, if the user answers yes, the program should save the data to a .txt file.

# Variables for the program should be named according to the data it represents. Comments need to be entered so that anyone who looks at the code can figure out what is happening. Error traps need to be used to validate data that is entered. Remember to keep the program as simple as possible, and add complexity if desired only after the core program works.

#     The program is free of syntax errors (25 points)
#     The program is free of logic errors (25 points)
#     The program adds currency values for each store (25 points)
#     The program adds store totals for a grand total (25 points)
#     The program catches all errors (25 points)
#     The program creates a text file with the correct information (25 points)
#     The program makes use of relevant variable names (15 points)
#     The program makes good use of comments (10 points)
