Lists in python are a type of Array

Code example
```python
my_list = ["A", "B", "C"]
```
Each entry in the list will be an element. In the above example
- A is in index position 0
- B is in index position 1
- C is in index position 2

The list can be accessed in reverse order using negative numbers
- C is in index position -1
- B is in index position -2
- A is in index position -3

To access and element we can use the index number:
```python
my_list = ["A", "B", "C"]
print(my_list[0])
```
To add to a list we can:
```python
my_list = ["A", "B", "C"]
print(my_list[0])
```
